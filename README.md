# MNIST

Exploration of the MNIST classfication problem that I presented for educational purposes during a prelection at **Artificial Intelligence Society ,,Czarna Magia''** at Univerisity of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn.

### What was covered on the prelection?

- Creating `Datasets` and `DataLoaders`.
- Implementing a Base Line model.
- Creating a Training Loop.

### What else can be done?

This problem is verry simple, we could achive an accuracy of `0.98` without any problems. Normally you would do some experiments and try out more models. That is what I hope we will do together in the future at ,,Czarna Magia" meetings!

### What do you need to run the code?

Install the following libraries;

- `matplotlib` - `conda install -c conda-forge matplotlib`
- `pytorch` - https://pytorch.org/

### Resources

- [PyTorch for Deep learning](https://www.udemy.com/course/pytorch-for-deep-learning/) - a great course for learning PyTorch.
